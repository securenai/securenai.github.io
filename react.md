## Typography Elements in One

Let's start with a informative paragraph. **This text is bolded.** But not this one! _How about italic text?_ Cool right? Ok, let's **_combine_** them together. Yeah, that's right! I have code to highlight, so `ThisIsMyCode()`. What a nice! Good people will hyperlink away, so [here we go](#) or [http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com).

<div class="divider"></div>

<div class="divider"></div>

## Footnote

Let's say you have text that you want to refer with a footnote, you can do that too! This is an example for the footnote number one [[^1]]. You can even add more footnotes, with link! [[^2]]

<div class="divider"></div>
<div class="divider"></div>

## List Items

1. First order list item
2. Second item

* Unordered list can use asterisks
